# Pharmaceutical-Sales-Prediction_Rossmann
## Forecast sales using store, promotion, and competitor data
For companies to strive in this competitive market, they need to leverage the power of AI/ML in their day-to-day decision-making endeavors. Forecasting the number of sales and customers they’re going to have is a keen advantage and one can leverage either promotions or different marketing schemes to increase the income flow. Predictive models can take into account different historical effects like seasonality, holidays, promotions, and competitions like we see later on to make the most accurate predictions.

The data we’re going to use for this project is Rossmann’s store data which can be found here In this data, there are four files-- the train, store, test, and sample_submission CSV files

## About
The finance team at Rossman Pharmaceuticals wants to forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time. Managers in individual stores rely on their years of experience as well as their personal judgment to forecast sales. 

The data team identified factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting the sales across the various stores.

The task was to build and serve an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to analysts in the finance team.
